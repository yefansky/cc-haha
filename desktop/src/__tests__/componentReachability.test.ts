/**
 * Every component must be reachable from an entry point.
 *
 * This exists because the coverage gate could not tell "no test" from "no callers".
 * `BackgroundTasksBar`, `SessionTaskBar` and `TeamStatusBar` lost their last import in
 * 56a4be3d1 when `SessionActivityPanel` replaced them. Nothing noticed: 598b968ee then
 * wrote tests for two of them — its message says "cover the components left at zero" —
 * purely to lift changed-lines coverage past the gate, and c712f5285 restyled all three
 * during the UI redesign. 577 component lines and 348 test lines were maintained for
 * code no user could reach, and nine translation keys were carried in five locales for
 * it.
 *
 * A coverage number cannot catch that; reachability can, and it has to run first.
 *
 * Scoped to `.tsx`. The `.ts` side has real entry points a static import graph cannot
 * see — `workspaceDiffHighlight.worker.ts` is loaded through `new Worker(new URL(...))`
 * and `src/preview-agent/**` is built into its own bundle by scripts/build-preview-agent.ts
 * — so covering it needs an allowlist, and an allowlist is where this kind of check goes
 * to die. Components have no such escape hatches, and the list below is empty.
