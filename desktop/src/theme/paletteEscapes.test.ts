/**
 * Blocks new uses of Tailwind's stock palette (`bg-amber-50`, `text-red-400`, …).
 *
 * Those classes are fixed colors. They do not move with `data-theme`, so a
 * component using them renders identically under all three themes — the same
 * defect as a hardcoded hex, except `tokenUsage.test.ts` cannot see it: there
 * is no `var()` to fail to resolve.
 *
 * This is a ratchet, not a clean sweep. The files below predate the component
 * library and are allowed to keep what they have; they may not grow, and no new
 * file may join them. Reduce a count when you convert some, and delete the
 * entry when it reaches zero.

 * Known offenders, with the count they are allowed to keep.
 *
 * - `settings/H5AccessSettings.tsx` — two neutrals inside the QR panel. That panel
 *   is a hardcoded `bg-white` box because scanners need the contrast, so its text
 *   has to stay dark under `data-theme="dark"` as well. Theme tokens are the wrong
 *   answer here; the right one is a token pair for content on a permanently
 *   light surface, which does not exist yet. (The entry read `pages/Settings.tsx`
 *   until that file was split into one module per panel; the code is unchanged.)
 *
 * `StreamingIndicator.tsx` used to sit here with 20. Its retry banner is now on
 * the `warning` token pair, so it needed no `dark:` variants at all — the entry
 * is gone rather than reduced.
 *
 * `PetApp.tsx` used to sit here with 3, all in one `rose` error banner. It is
 * now on the `error` token pair, so its `dark:` variant went away with it —
 * that variant only ever covered one of the three themes anyway.
 *
 * `ComputerUseSettings.tsx` used to sit here with 21 — the permission-tier
 * status colors. They are now `--color-{success,warning,error}` and their
 * `-container` pairs, which also retired the `/5`–`/30` alpha modifiers that
 * Safari 15 drops entirely.
